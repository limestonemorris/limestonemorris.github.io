Limestone Morris is a Morris dancing team based in Canberra. We perform traditional folk dances originally from the green and hilly Cotswolds region in the west of England. Morris dancing is beautiful, energetic and showy, often danced out in the street and always to live music.
<P>
We practice weekly on Thursday evenings in the city, a stumble away from Bentspoke. We are a friendly, inclusive team who enjoy dancing and hanging out with each other. We love to have new people: no experience needed, we'll teach you. Keen or curious? Send us an <A HREF="mailto:limestonemorris@gmail.com">email</A> or a <A HREF="https://facebook.com/limestonemorris">DM</A>!
<P>
We also like dancing at events and venues. If you would like to book us, <A HREF="mailto:limestonemorris@gmail.com">also send us a message.</A>
